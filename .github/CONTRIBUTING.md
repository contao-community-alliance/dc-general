# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in IRC (#contao.cca on freenode).
We want you working on things you're excited about.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to DC_General, which
is hosted in the [Contao Community Alliance organization][1] on GitHub. These
are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgement and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Submitting issues

* Use the search function to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.
* Describe the issue in detail and include all the steps to follow in order to
  reproduce the bug.
* Include the version of Contao, PHP and DC_General you are using (if possible
  with a detailed list of other installed extensions that might be related).
* Include screenshots or screencasts if possible; they are immensely helpful.
* If you are reporting a bug, please include any related error message you are
  seeing and also check the `system/logs/error.log` file. The error message is
  not just the message but also the complete(!) stack trace below the message.
  This trace is a long list of function calls which helps us to diagnose the
  problem en detail.

## Submitting changes

* Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Contao Community Alliance][1] with a
  clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests][2]).
* When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include
  phpunit tests. We can always use more test coverage.
* Please follow the [phpcq 2.0][3] coding standards.
* Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (only one feature or fix per
  commit).
* We use phpcq/all-tasks in these projects, so please check your changes
  using phpcq when submitting a pull request.
* Create your pull request against the [`master`][4] branch for bug fixes or the
  [`develop`][5] branch for new features.
* Include screenshots in your pull request whenever possible.

Always write a clear log message for your commits.
One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look
like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Testing

We have a handful of unit tests. Please write unit tests for new code you
create.

## Git commit messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to …" not "Moves cursor to …").
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally.
